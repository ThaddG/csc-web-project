          He'll go, 'Check this out, tell me what you think.' Which speaks volumes 
          about who he is and how he sees and views people. Every person has a voice 
          and an idea, so he's sincerely looking to hear what you have to say—good, 
          bad, or whatever ... When he has his beats or his rhymes, he offers them 
          to the committee and we're all invited to dissect, strip, or add on to 
          what he's already started. By the end of the sessions, you see how he 
          integrates and transforms everyone's contributions, so the whole is 
          greater than the sum of its parts. He's a real wizard at it. What he 
          does is alchemy, really

          He's definitely hip-hop, his roots, I was testing him on joints ... He 
          takes it to another level which is dope. He had these musicians and this 
          song, they played around my little raggedy beat and made it real. I love 
          the way he works – he goes from one room, writing rhymes then goes to 
          another beat and goes to another room and does something else – I love 
          what he's done

          Despite the heavyweights assembled, the egos rarely clash; talks are sprawling, 
          enlightening, and productive ... we are here to contribute, challenge, and 
          inspire

          Each morning begins with a 10 a.m. breakfast at Kanye's Diamondhead residence. 
          Pusha, Tip, RZA, Cudi, Cons, and Kanye's crew slowly assemble to enjoy the 
          absurdly tasty cooking of Kanye's in-house chefs. If you're smart, you order 
          the French toast with the flambéed banana. An hour later, Kanye pulls up in 
          his Porsche Panamera, fresh from the studio. That's right, from the studio. 
          During my five days in Hawaii, Kanye never slept at his house, or even in a 
          bed. He would, er, power-nap in a studio chair or couch here and there in 
          90-minute intervals, working through the night. Engineers remained behind 
          the boards 24 hours a day.
